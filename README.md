The Geospatial Epidemiology of Non-Communicable Diseases: An Integrated Analysis of Socio-Environmental Risk Factors
1. Nationwide high-resolution mapping: We will perform an India-wide spatial 
analysis of NCDs, covering all districts. This addresses a known gap, since 
existing programs “are mostly based on state and district data, which overlook 
health disparities within macro units”. By mapping breast cancer, lung/liver 
cancer, CVD and stroke incidence at sub-district scale, we uncover local hotspots 
hidden by coarse aggregates. Such comprehensive national NCD maps have not 
been produced before. 
2. Integrated multi-disease modeling: Our GIS framework simultaneously 
analyzes multiple NCDs (breast, lung, liver cancers, CVD and stroke) rather than 
one disease alone. This leverages the untapped potential of satellite data for 
NCDs – systematic reviews note that geospatial methods for NCDs are “largely 
untapped” in low-income settings. Aligning all diseases over 2018–2022 lets us 
compare and contrast risk patterns across conditions, revealing overlapping 
clusters in a way not attempted by prior single-disease studies. 
3. Incorporation of environmental exposures: We will regularly integrate 
satellite-derived environmental variables (NDVI greenness and air pollutants 
PM₂.₅/NO₂/SO₂) into our models. In India, environmental risk factors (like air 
quality or greenspace) “were not commonly associated with health inherently” in 
past research , so this is novel. By fusing NDVI and pollution layers with our NCD 
data, we uniquely quantify how greenness and air quality impact local NCD 
burdens.  
4. Socioeconomic and healthcare factors: We overlay socioeconomic status 
(income/SES), population density, and healthcare access in the spatial analysis. 
Most prior NCD mapping studies only include basic covariates like age or income 
, but seldom in a detailed geospatial model for India. Adding SES and access 
metrics will reveal how social determinants drive disease patterns – for example, 
highlighting rural districts with low income and poor clinic access that coincide 
with high NCD rates.
